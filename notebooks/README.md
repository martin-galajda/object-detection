# Jupyter notebooks


## How to use

Follow instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install) to install and use Jupyter notebooks. 

If you followed instructions from the [root README](https://github.com/martinGalajdaSchool/object-detection/blob/master/README.md) for installing virtual environment, then you can run notebooks by executing `jupyter notebook .`  in the root directory (make sure virtual environment is activated).
